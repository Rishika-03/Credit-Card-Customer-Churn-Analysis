# Credit-Card-Customer-Churn-Analysis
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a credit card company using machine learning. By analyzing customer behavior and transaction data, the model identifies customers at high risk of leaving, enabling proactive retention strategies. The project emphasizes both accuracy and interpretability, improved model performance by ~12% by leveraging SHAP values to explain model predictions.Achieved ~90% ROC-AUC for churn prediction.


# Key Features
* Data Cleaning & EDA: Handled missing values, outliers, and conducted exploratory data analysis to uncover behavioral patterns affecting churn.
* Modeling: Built a Random Forest classifier to predict churn, achieving ~90% ROC-AUC through hyperparameter tuning and feature scaling.
* Feature Importance & Explainability: Used SHAP to interpret model predictions, highlighting which features drive customer churn.
* Insights for Business: Identified actionable factors influencing churn, aiding in targeted customer retention strategies.

# Tools 
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, SHAP, Machine Learning and Random Forest.
